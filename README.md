## 🎯 About  
`devmode` is a shell script that simplifies managing local coding workspaces on Android or Linux devices. With devmode, you can create a workspace by selecting specific files and folders, run the workspace using popular editors (SPCK, SPCK Node.js, Acode), and automatically sync changes between your workspace and the original directory.

## 🛠️ Usage

2. Choose the default editor (SPCK, SPCK Node.js, or Acode).


3. Run the workspace — devmode copies files and starts automatic sync.


4. Press Ctrl+C to stop syncing.


5. Use the delete workspace command to remove workspaces you no longer need.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Workspaces are saved as JSON files under ~/devmode/config/.

Editor folders are configured for Android (SPCK, Acode) or Linux paths.

File/folder filters exclude large folders, symlinks, and unwanted directories like node_modules.
